# Cantabile
An open-source font derived from Fontworks' Klee One, ideal for body text.  

## Introduction
Cantabile is a script font handwritten by pencil or pen. It's quiet design has an elegant look that sets itself apart from traditional script and textbook fonts. Ideal for body text.  
In December 2020, Japanese type foundry FONTWORKS released [7 Open-source Japanese fonts](https://github.com/fontworks-fonts) on GitHub, with [Klee One](https://github.com/fontworks-fonts/Klee) supporting the most characters. It shares some features with Fangsong and Kaiti, namely elegant composition and high readability. Unlike the textbook-style font, Klee One retains some features of traditional printed fonts.  
In 2021, the font [LXGW WenKai](https://github.com/lxgw/LxgwWenKai) was made by [lxgw](https://github.com/lxgw), which was modified from Klee One, with some characters added. It has become a success. Other font designers also made fonts derived from Klee One, such as [Iansui](https://github.com/ButTaiwan/iansui), [JyunsaiKaai](https://github.com/ItMarki/jyunsaikaai), and so on.
